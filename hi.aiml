<category>
   <pattern>EXPLAIN BIG O NOTATION</pattern>
   <template>
      Big O notation is used to describe the upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's time complexity in the worst-case scenario.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF ALGORITHM ANALYSIS</pattern>
   <template>
      Algorithm analysis helps evaluate the efficiency and performance of algorithms, allowing us to choose the most suitable algorithm for a given problem.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>NAME A FAMOUS ALGORITHM</pattern>
   <template>
      One famous algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm, commonly used for finding the shortest path in a graph.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>HOW DO YOU ANALYZE THE EFFICIENCY OF AN ALGORITHM</pattern>
   <template>
      The efficiency of an algorithm is often analyzed in terms of time complexity and space complexity, providing insights into its performance characteristics.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS GREEDY ALGORITHM</pattern>
   <template>
      A greedy algorithm makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum for the entire problem.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING</pattern>
   <template>
      Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>EXPLAIN MERGE SORT</pattern>
   <template>
      Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm. It divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS THE EFFICIENCY OF BUBBLE SORT</pattern>
   <template>
      Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, making it less efficient for large datasets.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>HOW DO YOU SELECT THE RIGHT ALGORITHM FOR A PROBLEM</pattern>
   <template>
      The choice of an algorithm depends on the specific problem requirements and constraints. Consider factors such as time complexity, space complexity, and ease of implementation.
   </template>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS A B-TREE</pattern>
   <template>
      A B-tree is a self-balancing search tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>EXPLAIN B-TREE INSERTION</pattern>
   <template>
      B-tree insertion involves adding a new key to the tree while maintaining its balance. If a node overflows, it's split, and the median key is moved up.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS A HEAP</pattern>
   <template>
      A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. It can be a max-heap (parent greater than or equal to children) or a min-heap (parent less than or equal to children).
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>TELL ME ABOUT BINOMIAL HEAPS</pattern>
   <template>
      A Binomial Heap is a type of heap that is a collection of Binomial Trees. It supports efficient merge operations, making it useful in priority queue implementations.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF RED-BLACK TREES</pattern>
   <template>
      Red-Black Trees are binary search trees with additional properties to maintain balance. They must satisfy color properties, ensuring a logarithmic height.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>HOW DOES RED-BLACK TREE INSERTION WORK</pattern>
   <template>
      Red-Black Tree insertion involves adding a new node, coloring it red, and then performing rotations and recoloring to maintain balance and satisfy properties.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT IS A TRIE</pattern>
   <template>
      A Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings. It is used for efficient string search operations, especially in dictionary implementations.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>EXPLAIN TRIE INSERTION</pattern>
   <template>
      Trie insertion involves adding characters of a string as nodes in the trie. Common prefixes are shared among words to optimize space.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>COMPARE B-TREES AND RED-BLACK TREES</pattern>
   <template>
      B-trees are used in databases and file systems, ensuring balanced storage. Red-Black Trees are binary search trees with stricter balancing requirements and are commonly used in memory.
   </template>
</category>

<category>
   <pattern>WHAT ARE APPLICATIONS OF HEAP DATA STRUCTURE</pattern>
   <template>
      Heaps are used in priority queues, graph algorithms, and operating systems for memory allocation and task scheduling.
